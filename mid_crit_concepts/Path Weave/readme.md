## Brief field research summary
After reflecting on my lifestyle in my personal space, I found myself concerned on an unusual topic more than I should: 'How to avoid your roommates.' Indeed, some people live in shared flats with others, but sometimes (most of the time), they just donâ€™t want to interact with them. Accordingly, my research became fixated on ways to prevent or bypass these interactions by any means.

# Path Weave

## Summary
The device is a physical representation of the common space in your flat that you can customize by aranging the rooms. Motion sensors linked to the map are placed throughout the shared areas to track your roommates' movements. In real time, the map illuminates their paths, with the brightest coordinates indicating where each person was last located. As time passes, the light gradually dims, creating a dynamic visualization of activity in the flat. This interactive feature helps you stay informed about when and where your roommates are out of their rooms, allowing you to venture forth with ease and avoid unexpected encounters.
