## Summary
To summarize, with 'RPG Bot,' you’ll be able to shift between modes based on the situation and follow your needs. The device will support you in replenishing yourself, avoiding interaction, confronting others, or escaping in urgent situations, just like action commands in a role playing game.
The bottle-like robot, connected to your headset, will change color to signal your current need to others, which you could adjust by pressing it. 'Attack' (red) would pulse gently and lower the music to give you courage to speak, 'Shield' (blue) would enable noise-canceling and play music louder if necessary, 'Healing' (green) would emit relaxing sounds/music and have the light flicker in rythm in a calming way. Finally, 'Escape' (yellow) would play a ringtone or alarm-like sound, signaling that you need to leave quickly.
