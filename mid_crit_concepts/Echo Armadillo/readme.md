## Summary
The device lets you know from the safety of your room if your roommates are nearby. When it detects a presence, the armadillo curls up, signaling it’s ‘not safe’ to step out yet. If no movement is detected for a while, you can confidently venture out. Over time, it may also help you understand your roommates's patterns, reducing continuous anxiety and making it easier to avoid unwanted encounters.
