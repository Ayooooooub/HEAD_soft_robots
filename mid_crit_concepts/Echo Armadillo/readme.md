## Brief field research summary
After reflecting on my lifestyle in my personal space, I found myself concerned on an unusual topic more than I should: 'How to avoid your roommates.' Indeed, some people live in shared flats with others, but sometimes (most of the time), they just don’t want to interact with them. Accordingly, my research became fixated on ways to prevent or bypass these interactions by any means.

# Echo Armadillo
A soft robot resembling an armadillo, it detects movement and sound from the other side of the door. When it senses someone nearby, it curls up, signaling that your roommates are out of their rooms.

## Summary
The device lets you know from the safety of your room if your roommates are nearby. When it detects a presence, the armadillo curls up, signaling it’s ‘not safe’ to step out yet. If no movement is detected for a while, you can confidently venture out. Over time, it may also help you understand your roommates' patterns, reducing continuous anxiety and making it easier to avoid unwanted encounters.
