## Project title 
Think a simple, straightforward title, can also be poetic or playful but keep it short. 

## Research Question / area of research
How can I relieve myself from potential encounters with my roommates in our shared flat? How can I avoir them when I feel like I dont want to see them

## Pitch
My flower device signals if roommates are in shared spaces, it closes when detected, vibrates for crowds.

+ Key visual (from your 3D renderings or your paper prototypes)
+ Optional second visual

## Prototyping research
Describe in a short paragraph (~500 chars) the research that you have conducted around your prototypes. What were your intentions? What are the several forms you looked into? What were the different interactions you tried? Illustrate each method with corresponding photo, sketches, audio, movies, 3D visuals etc. You can put a lot of elements here, but please curate the most illustrative materials.

## Your key prototype
My project is a flower-like device that alerts me if my roommates are in the shared space. Each room could have a device resembling a flower. It remains naturally open but closes when someone is detected outside. If more than two people (matching the number of my roommates) are detected, it vibrates to alert me of a greater threat.

+ One photo of the paper prototype (can be gif animation, or static)
+ One 3D image 
+ (Optional) Audio
+ (Optional) Video

## User scenario
+ Your storyboard showing how your prototype can be used 

## Next Steps
In one sentence, describe what you will focus on next.
