# Progress over the past few days

## 3D model

- The 3D model has been revamped and now includes everything except the thin paper part that serves as the Calystegia petal.
- After 3D printing the object, there still are a few issues and it kinda got messed up on the bottom so I'll do a few other iterations to come the the ultimate design.
