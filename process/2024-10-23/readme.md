# Giga brainstorm 

# Shield
Introvert
ex : noise cancelling eadphones permits a certain form of shield, cutting myself from the exterrior.
But noise cancelling headphones make me feel shielded because I feel in an other realm.
On the other hand, people around dont have those headphones and thus don't feel this distance I am trying to create.
Shielded is not the same as Untouchable

Otherwise, you can "Dire les termes" and set the rules for everyone to understand. Either by communicating from the get go the boundaries your aiming to set. Or you have an intermediate that communicates with RM so u don't have 2.


# Weapon
On the opposit sied you have the weapon aspect that is not made to protect yourself ftom others but to gain the ability by surpassing thy self to go towards ur RM.

Surpassing oneself is a thing but maybe the robot can be once again the intermediate that could permit in a certain way a connection


# Safe Space
The safe room/space is the metaphor of the room that is first of all the only place that is not shared in the flat so THE place to recharge.
You can recharge your social battery and not have to wear any mask.
U are alone in that room so u dont have to adapt to others, u dont have to be aware of people's gaze and juste be ur trueself
In ur room you will likely do the types of activities that you like, reading, playing video games, watching movies/series and so on.

The notion of time is quite relevent too. When you find your self outside, everything and everyone is constantly moving. Once you enter your room, everything stops, there is nothing new that could distabilize thyself, thus, you may feel at peace.

# Time Efficiency
At first, twas about planning and trying to be more efficient. Then it went a bit further and approached the matter of rights depending on conditions. Like RM could be allowed to setp out of their rooms at certain time depending on something, gaining time bonuses based on how good they are doing.

Eventually thanks to my comrades I found out that managing my routine to spend less time in common spaces to avoid my RM was a way to "escape" and led to a metaphor of "surviving".
Furthermore, having the urge to spend time outside would mean that the problem is the flat it self but then what to do?
Designing a soft robots around domestic space while escaping the domestic space is an interesting concept.

# A link between worlds
Nevertheless, every category could be linked to one robot whose purpose is to serve as an intermediary between you and your RM
Similarly to a turn based RPG the robot could alow you to choose an "action" command depending on your mood or curent desires.
You would be able to "attack", "Shield", "heal" or "escape".
