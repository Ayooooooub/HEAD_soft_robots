I continued exploring various ways to represent a gauge.

Here I got inspired by prayer wheels usualy tied to buddhism.

Then, I continued exploring designs that might be less conventional. And I worked on incorporating a third state more prominently, even by introducing a new color.

At one point, I revisited the opening and closing mechanism, drawing inspiration from fruits and how they unfold.

In the end, I focused on the opening mechanism and returned to the flower design.
