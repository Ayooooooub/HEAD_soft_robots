# Today is about coding

- Now that the 3D model is close to being done, I'll concentrate on the communication between the two Calystegia.  

- I'm asking ChatGPT for help to know where to connect the wires between Arduinos and for the general code.

- Communication between both Calystegia works well. Right now, they both close when movement is detected from the sender (outside Calystegia is the sender, and inside is the receiver).

- Having issues adding the new "jealousy" state. I got help from Douglas to understand the code better, but there is still work to be done.
