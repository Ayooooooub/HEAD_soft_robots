Researching textures and exploring how to convey emotions and dynamic states through paper-cutting techniques.

Exploring ways to express opening and closing through paper. I experimented with a flower design that blossoms and retracts, and felt like it worked. Additionally, I tried a hedgehog-inspired concept to further explore this opening mechanism.

This iteration of the gauge concept, linked to the turf war project, explores a design less monolithic, that would be more than a single color-changing element. I made a structure that connects paper strips that can move together to form a large, unified gauge or independently, allowing for the representation of multiple states rather than just two.
