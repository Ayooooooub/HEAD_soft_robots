The word "sentinel" is connected to senses in its etymological roots. It originates from the Latin word "sentire," which means "to feel," "to perceive," or "to sense." Over time, this root evolved into the Italian word "sentinella" (meaning "guard" or "sentry"), and from there into English as "sentinel."

The connection makes sense, as a sentinel's primary role is to be alert, perceptive, and aware of potential threats—essentially, to use their senses vigilantly.
